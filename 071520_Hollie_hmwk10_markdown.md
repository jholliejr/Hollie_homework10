1. The ARMA model is not a good fit based on a p-value above 0.05.
2. Based on the ARIMA forecast, the yen should increase in the short term.
3. I would not buy the yen because I don't trust the models.
4. The risk is projected to increase.
5. No, I have no confidence in these models.  Both have a p-value above 0.05.
